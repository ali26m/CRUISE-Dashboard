# CRUISE Dashboard

### The project involves designing a database model, implementing a cloud-based NoSQL database using MongoDB Atlas, and developing and deploying a live, updated Streamlit web application. The app maintains an open connection with the operational database on Atlas, performs ETL tasks on the data, and pushes the cleaned data into a simple, well-designed dashboard.
